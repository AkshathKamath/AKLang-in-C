# AKLang

### Motivation

- Im learning systems programming in C and what better way than to implement pointers knowledge than building a programming language that is built on top of C.

### Features

- This language is like Python, all data is created as objects on the Heap Memory with Data Structures I have implemented (or plan to implement) like:
  - Dynamic Array
  - Tries
  - Heaps
  - Hash Maps
  - Some complex trees
- Garbage Collector to free memory from the Heap and avoid dreaded memory leaks
  - Mark and Sweep Garbage Collector
- Plan to implement an interpreter in the future to actually run code
